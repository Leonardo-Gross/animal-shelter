# animal-shelter

A simple web page to practice what I'm currently learning about Vue 3, TypeScript, and Tailwind.

In this application, you can register an account, which is currently saved in LocalStorage. Then, you can log in and access the Animals View, where you'll find a list of animals available for adoption. I used modals to assist with the registration process and logging out.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).
